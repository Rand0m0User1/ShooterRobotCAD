# ShooterRobotCAD

Began with drivetrain and intake prior to the establishment of the github commit rule. Images of each mechanism are still linked in their respective folders.

Drivetrain:
27.5 x 27.5 in
MK4i Swerve Modules

Intake:
4-bar linkage modeled off of FRC 1678's design
Motor driven to omit usage of pneumatics systems + allows for a more compact design
